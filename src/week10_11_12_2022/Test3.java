/*Task 2 : Four or less


                    Given an Array of Strings, go through and read only Strings that are 4 characters or less.

                    Take those Strings and put them into a different Array

                    Ex:

                    Input:
                    “apples”, “tree”, “loop, “cat”, “animal”, “shortcut”

                    Output:
                    [ tree, loop, cat ]
*/





    }
